# Data

Dataset 2 (Fetal brain MRI)

This dataset consists of T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI scans of fetal brains. The brain has been manually segmented by an expert to provide ground truth labels. The dimensions of T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI images, respectively, are 256 x 256 x S and 128 x 128 x S voxels, where S is the number of slices in the scan. In other words, the size of each 2D slice for T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted scans are 256 x 256 and 128 x 128, respectively. The within-slice resolutions vary. Scans are available as NIfTI files (.nii.gz).
